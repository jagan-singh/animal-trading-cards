			<p>The lion (Panthera leo) is a species in the family Felidae; it is a muscular, deep-chested cat with a short, rounded head, a reduced neck and round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail.
				A lion pride consists of a few adult males, related females and cubs.
				 The species is an apex and keystone predator, although they scavenge when opportunities occur. </p></div>
